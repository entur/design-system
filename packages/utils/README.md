# Utils

This package contains the different utils shared across the Entur Linje packages.

This package will probably change with lots of breaking changes as we move along. It's meant for internal consumption only, so please excuse our mess. It will only be documented via its code.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @entur/utils
# or if you are using Yarn:
yarn add @entur/utils
```
