# Colors

Entur has a large palette of colors that's easy to use.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @entur/colors
```

## Usage

You should load the css file containing the colors as soon as possible in your application. Other components might require the css properties contained in this file to be present in order to be styled correctly.

```js
import '@entur/colors/colors.css';
```

After this is included, you can refer to the css properties throughout your code without loading them again.

### JavaScript

The colors are also exported as a JavaScript object as well - keyed by the type of color (primary, secondary etc), and then by name. The colors are provided in the hex format (i.e. #123abc).

```js
import colors from '@entur/colors';

const Example = () => <div style={{ backgroundColor: colors.primary.blue }} />;
```

## How to choose what colors to use

Good question! Let's get back to that.

## Available colors

### Primary colors

<ColorList colors={colors.primary} category="primary" />

### Secondary colors

<ColorList colors={colors.secondary} category="secondary" />

### Tertiary colors

<ColorList colors={colors.tertiary} category="tertiary" />

### Validation colors

<ColorList colors={colors.validation} category="validation" />

### Miscellaneous colors

<ColorList colors={colors.misc} category="misc" />

### Transport colors

We have a separate set for the different transport types:

#### Default theme

<ColorList colors={colors.transport.default} category="transport-default" />

#### Midnight theme

<ColorList colors={colors.transport.midnight} category="transport-midnight" />
