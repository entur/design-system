# Entur Design System

Welcome to the Entur Design System documentation web site. You'll find usage and API documentation for all of our shared components, as well as good descriptions on how to combine them.

## Want to contribute?

Although the Entur Design System is maintained by the design system team, it's mostly made up of contributions from people working in the different product teams.

If you have a feature request, a bug report or want to contribute to the documentation, please let us know via Slack and Jira. You can always connect with us at #talk-designsystem.

The maintainers are Nicolai Fredriksen (nicolai.fredriksen@entur.org) and Kristofer Giltvedt Selbekk (kristofer.giltvedt.selbekk@entur.org).
