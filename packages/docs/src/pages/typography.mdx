# Typography

Right now, the only typography component we have is the `<PageHeading />` component.

## `<PageHeading />`

Used at most once on every screen. Should be the main topic of what the user will be doing, reading or learning on that particular screen.

### Props

<Props of={PageHeading} />

### Playground

<Playground>
  <PageHeading>Tickets</PageHeading>
</Playground>
