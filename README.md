# Entur Design System Monorepo

This is the monorepo containing all packages in the Entur Design System, as well as the documentation site.

You'll find all the code in the `packages/` folder. The documentation site is found in the `packages/docs/` folder.

## Contributing

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) specification. This lets us create new version numbers and change logs based on commit messages, instead of spending time on doing it manually.

We have added a tool called `commitizen` that helps you with following this standard. Simply run `git cz` instead of `git commit`, and you will be prompted with what kind of commit you want to make.
